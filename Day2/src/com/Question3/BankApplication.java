//Create the application class “Bank” which will have the main method. 
//First the application will require the user to create an account. So, you have to ask for user name, what type
//of account he wants to open and what would be the initial balance. The system will create the account
//(SavingsAccount or CurrentAccount object) with a randomly generated 5 digit account number.
//After creating the account, you have to provide a menu on the console. It will take user input to decide what
//action to take.
//Input ‘1’ means deposit money. For this input, you have to ask user for the amount of money he wants to
//deposit. Also you need to prompt if he needs to know the balance. If yes, you need to display the
//balance before the deposit and after the deposit.
//Input ‘2’ means withdraw money. So, you have to ask user for the amount of money he wants to withdraw.
//Also you need to prompt if he needs to know the balance. If yes, you need to display the balance
//before the withdrawal and after the withdrawal.
//Input ‘3’ means display the balance of the account. In that case you have to display the balance.
//Input ‘0’ means exit the system.
